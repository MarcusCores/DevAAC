You can use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) language writing news.
If you need help, you can use an [online editor like Dilliger.io](http://dillinger.io/) to format the text.


Here are some examples:

# Hello There
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "I'm the title") of an inline link.

### Define a list below

+ Get milk
+ Buy food
    - pizza
    - even more pizza
    - and some ketchup, too

This is paragraph text with some **bold** or some _italics_ how about _**both**_ ?

**Code** block below:

    function hello() {
      alert('Hello world!');
    }
